# War-Game
War card game made in Java

The purpose of these exercise was to consolidate most of the skills learned during the course and construct a working application by yourself.

The game allows to read JSON data from files to create deck for 2-5 players, with cards in the range of 1-14. Cards can be shuffled or not. Game
plays like the standard card game it's based on, including situations when 2 or more players have the same a card (a duel). In the case of too many
rounds game will be stopped and the winner will be chosen from the remaining players, if possible. Players do not need to interact with a program once it's
started since it's an automated game and doesn't really need any choice during play. There are messages playing through the game to let the players know how
it's going.
